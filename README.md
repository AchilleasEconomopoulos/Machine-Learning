#  Machine Learning - Email Classification (Spam / Non-Spam) #

----------

As the title suggests, this project is an application that sorts Emails from a specific dataset (**pu3**) into spam and non-spam. This is done through the use of two very famous machine learning classifiers / algorithms: **Naive Bayes** and **Logistic Regression**. The project was assigned as a prerequisite to pass the Artificial Intelligence course in the Athens University of Economics and Business.
